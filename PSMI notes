SM should have a Working Agreement with the Team - based on the Scrum Values - Core Working hours | Daily Scrum | Leave Plans | PO is remote - Agree to have 1 hr | Once a week Scrum at US Time to accomodate Peers in US TZ.

Timebox the Events.

Conflicts - Let Team solve - Votes - Why - Experiment - Use Veto

Right questions on the floor

-------

SM serves the PO, Developers, Organization--> Contribution to SM Community

"Optimize" - 

"Facilitation" - Act as a Bouncing Board | Give opportunities for everyone | Probing | Timeboxing | 

"Servant Leadership" -- Didnt command people to follow. Leaders through Service.
Leaders have a vision. 

SM as a Carpenter - Has a Tool Kit - Uses appropriate Tool depending on the Situation

----

What is an impediment
Not an Impediment but appears as an Impediment

"Impediment" - something beyond the Team's Capacity
Ask - What have u done about it so far?
No assumptions. Base on data. 

---

Complexities - Variables - In your Control - Out of your Control

Thermostat - Constant Adaptation
Variables doesnt matter much

Complexity of Product Development:
---------------------------------------

Ralph Stacey:
Requirements -- Technology -- People


- Simple (Predictive- Easy to replicate it - Can use Waterfall) 
- Complicated  
- Complex (Knowledge Work) - Best Practices doesnt work. Need to use Empiricism ( Evidence based / Learning based / Fact based/ Data based / Adaptive approach and not Predicive approach) Other exampls: COVID 19 / Cancer / Mars
- Chaotic

*******Project Mindset Vs Product Mindset
----------------------------------------------
Scope | Budget/Cost | Time

In Agile: Scope is Variable

Metrics - Deadline of Time, Cost

Plan driven  Vs. Value driven

Metrics:
----------------
Pilot Metrics / Operation Metrics / Delivery Metrics

Aeroplane - Talk to 

Business Metrics:
Customers Satisfaction
Employee Satisfaction
Innovation rate - Maintenance vs R&D or Development of new features

ANZ Company

Velocity is a measue of progress.. not productivity. Dont try to push Velocity to meet deadline

Net Promoter Score

Empiricism:
---------------------
Example Marathon: Capacity


Prediction:
Range
Optimistic vs Pessimistic Velocity

--------------------

Loaning Resources

---------------------

Change in Habit -- Left hand vs Right hand

Scrum will surface your problems,

Present based on data nad not Perception

Keep beating the drums

-----------------------------
3 5 (3 3) 5

Scrum Team | Scrum Events | Scrum Artifacts | Artefict Commitments | Scrum Values
-----------------------------

Definition of Ready - Description - Order - Size

Grooming word -- removed

-----------------------------

Technical Debt: Intentional debt where Quality is compromised to gain speed. How to deal with it? - Add a PBI
 
Value Realization is important

---------------------------------------------------------------------
PO : Value Maximizer | Responds to Market Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Sprint Goal - Gives Focus / Shared Goal / gives Purpose -- only 1 goal

Sprint Backlog is a living document - 

Capacity is only for Developers. Not for measuring Productivity

Sprint -- Can put % of ur capacity

****** Retro:  -- is a Private Event

Trust has to be earned

------Retro - What to discuss? 360 - People | Process | Practices
Be Creative in formats & Tools
Google: Sprint Retrospective Ideas
Theme based


Sprint Review --- Also talk about PBIs for next Sprint.

------------

PO interfaces with the Customer side - Excitment / Value

PO - Business
SM - Process
Developers - Quality

1 Product Vision ----> many Product Goal

1Product = 1 Product Goal = 1 Product backlog = 1 PO = many Teams working on it


-----------------------------------

Sprint Backlog --- Visible to the Developers -- SM, PO optional

Every Meeting everyone attends

PO also attends Retro

-----

Sprint Review: helps in Release Planning

Increment Transparency is reflected when DoD is visible and understood.

---------

Event | What is Inspected | What is adapted
Sprint Review | Increment | Product Backlog
Sprint Retro | DoD | Sprint Backlog
Sprint Planning | Product Backlog | Sprint Backlog
Daily Scrum | Sprint Goal | Sprint Backlog
Sprint | 

------

Increment:

incements gradually........ big --> bigger

********* All the Scrum Team is accountable for the Increment

--------------

Many Teams in an Org. So Org / few knowledgable people lay the starting point.
But it needs buyin from Developers and 

------------

Cross functional Teams - Feature Teams
component based vs feature based

3 Ingredients of Self-management
----------------------------------------
Common / Shared Goal help Self-Organized
Accountability took us forward
Time box / boundary condition defined ----- mix of jr, Sr | composition of Java, Web, UX, DBA | by 2 hrs.

-------------
Challenge the Status Quo -- Confront People - Pick up the battle - Thick Skin


half-baked / half-done Items are of no value


What is the give-away word?

Acceptance Criteria ---- Scrum Team is accountable??? not just PO

----------
Output is based on the stage Team is in
Bru Stuckman Mode - Team: Forming - Storming - Norming - Performing
