Human System Dynamics



"Awareness and Consciousness"
----------------------------------
Be aware of your capabilities, Knowledge and Strengths

Differentiate between your Personal and Professional Self.

What makes a good Coach:
-------------------------
Have Empathy. People may share Personal matters.

Confidentiality: What/What not to disclose with the Stakeholders about the 1:1 you had with People.
Be Conscious that we do not discuss People. We discuss ideas.

Focus: Pomodoro approach.

Have clear Agenda, Clear instuction as to what you expect from them.

When you Your first start Transformation. Your relationship is of a Consultant (an Expert). 
Once they are comfortable with all questions... You sit back and observe. and then you coach.

Power of Now:
--------------------------
We'll focus on first 2 iterations

12 Principles of Agile:

Art of Simplicity: How you'd implement Simplicity in your Work Life Scenarios
Reflection: 

**Transformation includes:
----------------------------
People, Processes Tools/Infra, Org Culture

Understand what is the goal of transformation? It shouldnt be just cost optimization.

There's nothing like Knowledge Coaching.. Its all about Human Coaching.. If u can relate to, empathize with ppl,..

Consultant Vs Trainers Vs Coach

There'll be Slow moments/ Passive moments.

Feedback should be on Activity and Action.

As a Coach - "Power of Visualization" is very important.  ----> Bring in this within Teams
They should be able to visualize their Tasks. 


3 Steps:
------------
1. Transition
2. Change in the way of working
3. Transformation

Comb shaped skills: Jack of many, Master of 1

Find ur Strong areas:
---------------------------
Facilitation Coach
Product Coach
Leadership Coach

Y transformation is not favoured:
-------------------------------------
- Resistance/reluctance from mid management that they may become redundant
- Follower/ Execution mindset in Indian Culture. Team members are not empowered as decision makers at their level.

Working with People:
---------------------------
Social, approachable, Emotional Qoutient, able to empathize
Have you worked with People in different capacities. atleast 7-8 different teams.
Conscious, aware, 
Make judgement based om facts and not on emotions.

Coach cannot survive without discipline, risk taking, able to come out of comfort zone

Via Transformation, Coach changes People's perspective towards peple, making them Passionate, organize better/ plan better/ work better.

agile should be a part of KPI to the middle management given by the Leadership. Not just increasing the margin.

We must have a roadmap of bringing in the agile transformation.

Identify whether its just transition / pilot or transformation.

Adaptability is the key in VUCA.

State of Agile:
------------------------- 

Key Challenges | Success Factors How does success  look like | Impact of Indian Culture and Mindset | Impact of Socio Economic Status of India | Impact of COVID19
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are looked upon as an economy which is cost-effective and affordable and get Work Opportunity. Socio economic state of India. 
We need to have decision making power. It builds morale of Indian Management Team. Establish similar hierarchy in India. Deep Democracy.

We have a hierarchy, Authority culture. People dont want to give in their power. Transparency is effected. We associate age with Knowledge and respect.
Removing the threat aspects for the layers that are resisting. 

Organization Culture need to be bring in the change - empowering. everyone can challenge the decision.

We have accomodating culture. We donot say no - We stretch at the loss of work-life balance.

Not being paid well --- effects agile tools, trainings.

We have a frugal innovation mindset.

Young and Energetic minds.

There is resistance to change. Fear of failure. 

Alignment, Shift in mindset moving away from Predictability. Common understanding of vision and mission of Org and Teams. Not just presentation in the town-hall. 
address what is in it for me for each employee. Create a Story and connect people emotionally. Are we going to do pilot or big bang. How are we going to sustain, how are we going to handle failure
Create a psychologolical safe space where employees can ask questions, know better how things will be changing.

Underestimated the scope of work involved in Transformation. expectations have to set accordingly.
People's work has to be adjusted so that agile isnot considered extra/burden.

Coaching Competency at its core is missing.

QA Testing from Customer Experience point of view.

DevOps should be an integral part of Agile Transformation.

Challenge of trust -- in remote working. Leadership addressed this issue.
Tools are available.
How to have governance model.
Each team were given OKRs.

Why do we want to go for agile? Can u give 5 pain points? Is it chaotic or smooth?

Management is looking for Output based metrics and not outcome based metrics?
Hierarchcal verticals or silos. team members from different verticals.

Coaches and Leadership should talk the same language. Shouldnt talk framework lingo. but the Agile terms.

Use the Collective Intelligence of the Tribe.

BIG room planning | Problem solving | 

As an Agile enabler, how much time do you spend on an average in a month in helping individuals, teams, or leaders in improving their overall understanding of agile and lean principles, and to improve their effectiveness in daily work activities

Consulting: As an Agile enabler, how much time do you spend on an average in a month in consulting? (e.g., activities where rather than working with people, you take a system view and (re)design processes for your organisation/client in how the work is organised, managed, tracked and reported by various teams or individuals involved in it. You might/not be assisted by other individuals). put N/A if not applicable

Project Management: As an Agile enabler, how much time do you spend on an average in a month in project management functions? (e.g., planning, organising, staffing, leading, coordinating, controlling, tracking and communicating, etc. While these might be more pronounced for internal agile enablers, we recognise that even the external agile enablers might be called upon to perform such tasks periodically or sporadically). put N/A if not applicable *

Organisational Tasks: As an Agile enabler, how much time do you spend on an average in a month in undertaking organisational tasks? (e.g., assist your manager in overall strategy, business planning, budgeting, human resource planning, recruitment, etc?). put N/A if not applicable *

"Success Metrics: How is the success of agile initiatives or implementation measured inside your organisation OR at your Client? Mere awareness of these goals is not enough. What is key is to know the following:
- is the team aware of what is expected of them?
- these goals are explicitly stated in their individual and/or team goals, and their appraisals and any subsequent rewards are closely tied to those goals?
- these goals are not merely ""year-end"" goals but are broken-down into small interim milestones and measured and tracked at each delivery frequency (commensurate to the size of delivery) and finally
- these interim milestones are used by the teams to adapt their next delivery cycle to improve the possibility of hitting more close to the eventual goals"

Delivery impact: How is your delivery impact measured? *
There were clearly defined Delivery objectives and it was easy to measure impact
Direction of delivery is changing in nature and there weren't clear measuring points. Manager decided delivery impact
There were defined delivery impact metrics but they did not fit right, and needed change.
Every team has their own defined metrics, and that worked well for Organisation

Efficiency impact: While delivering software, how does the team know if their development practices are indeed getting improved? *
There were Retrospectives and checks in place, and they always helped team with delivery as well as improvement
There were Retrospectives and checks in place, but they were mere meetings and no improvement came out of them
Random approach, team will only be in fire fighting mode

Adaptability impact: How adaptable is your team to change? (for example, how soon can the team consider a new idea and test it (or even push it) into production, or how soon can a bad code be rolled back, or how cheaply can the software be modified for a new locale or a use case) *
Very Fast: They can pivot as per Market/Customer need
Very Slow: Too many approvals, decision makers and stakeholders make it extremely difficult to decide
Differ for each team: Some teams do well, while others struggle, depending on impact of their Product on Org
Entirely depends on the Manager, how strong or capable he is in making his way

Product impact: How does the product impact the market ? (for example, how does the product score in product reviews or a product shootout, etc.) *
We are not clear on that
We have Business Value, but we still don't understand how that maps to and evaluate Product impact
Though we don't have clarity but Product Owner / Management has clarity. They measure in some way
Entire team has clarity

Customer impact: How do the customers find your product?(For example, starting with the customer acquisition metrics (CPA) to how they find the product experience (NPS score of the product goes up from 63 to 76, or the engagement metrics (e.g. time spent, page views, etc.) go up by 34%, or the monetization metrics (e.g. CTR)) *
Yes, we are made aware of impact on customer via Prodcut Demo meetings, followed a clear communication and shared metrics on Customer Impact
No, we had hints, but no clarity. It appears that Management understands and takes necessary actions accordingly.
We are aware that Customer is unhappy, Management is stressed, and looks like there is no clearly defined way to measure it and hence plan to mitigate the same
We do not have metrics for customer happiness, engagement

Business impact: Were you and your team aware of how does the performance of your product influence the "topline" of the company? (i.e., the revenues that it brings in. For example, the market share of the product goes up from 12% to 17%, or the revenues of the product goes up by 23%, or the company position goes up from #7 to #4 as a result of undertaking the initiatives) *
Yes, team is aware, has clarity and visibility on this
No, we do not know, and we don't know who knows this, whom to ask
Product Owner or Manager was clearly aware and could answer our questions
