repetitive production process as opposed to a human centric and innovation focused
--------------
Adopting Six Sigma to produce software products or improve existing software development processes hasn’t been that popular mainly because Six Sigma has always been understood as a structured methodology for reducing variation in a repetitive production process as opposed to a human centric and innovation focused process such as software development.

However in order to assess the benefit of adopting Six Sigma to a software development team, Six Sigma should be looked at from a different perspective. A typical objective of using Six Sigma for software development teams would not be to reduce variation, but to remove waste and eliminate or reduce defects. 

It is useful in Going Lean & also Problem Solving

It’s simply about solving problems, by focusing on the right problems, which impacts the business and introduce costs to the organization. 
Six Sigma also, is about investigating problems to the level of their root causes and finding appropriate solutions rather than introducing a catalogue of predefined solutions.

agile teams focus on continuous improvement and adaptation to change in the form of Inspect and Adapt cycles which happens either through daily collaboration (e.g. in daily standup meetings) or through periodic vehicles such as retrospective meetings happening at the end of an iteration. During these checkpoints, most agile teams would focus on soft observations and short-­‐term improvement actions rather than adopt a bird-­‐ eye view or approach to problem solving and improvement. Also informed decision making at this stage sometimes is based only on soft observations not solid data and measures. And this is where Lean Six Sigma comes along.

The different phases of the DMAIC roadmap are [Define – Measure – Analyze – Improve – Control]
