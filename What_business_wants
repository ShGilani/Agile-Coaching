I’ve found there are six “levers” that organizations care most about.

Value: Are we meeting the customer’s needs?
Predictability: The ability to plan and deliver
Productivity: Getting more done in the same time or with the same resources
Quality: A product free of defects and issues
Stability: The organization can maintain this pace indefinitely
Growth: Is the organization growing and learning?

Agile Metrics:
----------------------------
Cycle Time (Productivity)
Escaped Defect Rate (Quality)
Planned-to-Done Ratio (Predictability)
Happiness Metric (Stability)
