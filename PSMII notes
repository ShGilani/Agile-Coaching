Respect: Respect for boundaries/ Respect for Timebox

Intro Carousel:
Future of Scrum is: Wider Adoption, Adaptability

Predictability Vs Adaptability
Solution is evolving as we learn. Short-term cycles planining/ continuous planning, Empiricism. No defined Project Plans.

Sel-Organizing --- no dictate. Treat people as Knowledge Workers and not Laboures. Managemnt just lays some boundaries. Within the boundaries, Let the Team Self-manage.

SM -- has to have People Skills. to handle human emotions.
Transparency: is always through Facts .. and not Perception.
Data is brought through Scrum Artifacts: Product Backlog (PO accountability) | Sprint Backlog (Developers) | Increment (Scrum Team)

For Complex work, there is no expert. there is no right answer.
