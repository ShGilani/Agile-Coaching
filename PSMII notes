Work Agreements --- Inline with Scrum Values.
Talk about Challenges | 
Respect: Respect for boundaries/ Respect for Timebox

Intro Carousel:
Future of Scrum is: Wider Adoption, Adaptability

Predictability Vs Adaptability
Solution is evolving as we learn. Short-term cycles planining/ continuous planning, Empiricism. No defined Project Plans.

Sel-Organizing --- no dictate. Treat people as Knowledge Workers and not Laboures. Managemnt just lays some boundaries. Within the boundaries, Let the Team Self-manage.

SM -- has to have People Skills. to handle human emotions.
Transparency: is always through Facts .. and not Perception.
Data is brought through Scrum Artifacts: Product Backlog (PO accountability) | Sprint Backlog (Developers) | Increment (Scrum Team)

For Complex work, there is no expert. there is no right answer.

SM serves PO, Developers, Org.
Developers serves PO
PO serves Customers/Stakeholders


1 Product Owner - many Product Managers
PO can take help of SMEs. But he/She is the Decision Maker.

Accountability Vs Responsilibity
Responsibility can be delegated but not the accountability.

What is Scrum: 3-5-3-3-3

Who can add PBIs to the Product Backlog? : Any one can add. But the accountability of Ordering lies with PO.

When the Sprint ends, unfinished PBIs goes back to Product Backlog.

The Top PBIs in Product Backlog are the ones "refined", The items below are unrefined/ vague/raw.

Product Refinement happens ( may be not as a meeting, but discussions, involving as required ppl) to get clarity on "WHAT"
Sprint Planning happens after Product Refinement, focusing on "How"

 Transparency | Inspection | Adaptation ----------- are the pillars of Empericism
 
 Stakeholders: Investors | Customer | Consumers | Govt./Legal |
 
Invite Manager to the Sprint Review.
Otherwise my Team will start inflating the numbers. Trust the Team.
We are working in a Complex Domain. These are our Impediments. Help us resolve them.
Velocity is a measure of Progress not Productivity. Its operational Metrics.

Create a Foundation of Trust in your Ecosystem. Psychological Safety and not culture of Fear by living the Scrum Values.
As a SM, I trust my Team, I trust my PO.

*** Developers forecast the Sprint Backlog and commit to the Sprint Goal.

What are the complementary practices?
Kanaban board, velocity, estimation, automation, pair programming

You can use/ignore as needed. Dont let it interfere/ hindrance to empiricism/agility.

Hardening/Stabilizing Sprint.

Part of efforts towards creating Business Value, other part as Support/Enablers/Adhoc work.

We dont like Individual Heroes.

Shouldnt be SM driven. Shouldn't be the sole Decision maker.

Leading by Example:
------------------------
Its ok to express vulnerability

Ability to Read the Room:
-----------------------------
Sense Energy drooping / Loud voices take over or suppress others / 

Retrospective Prime Directive:
-------------------------------
Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. â€”Norm Kerth


Give 5 mins to vent out. Silence has its own power

Impediment: something which is beyond the control of self-manging Team
Let the team first try to solve the problem.

Servant Leadership
Leaders have a vision which they achieve by serving

Coaching: is for a particular problem. Be a bouncing board, active listening, Ask powerful/open ended questions
so that people can come up with their own solutions

Mentoring: Relationship based. 

breakout rooms - u practiced Self-managing, boundary condition established (time box), working on common goal, given the accountability.

Team solutions are the best.

2 options for SM.
Calm down/ passify.

Actively not take action   | Take Action

"Training from back of the room"

Accountable for quality of Increment? Scrum Team and not just Developers

"Innovation rate" metrics used by PO
%money on R&D, %money on maintenance

Forming Teams based on "Component"(architecture building block/Layer/subsystem) or "Feature"

Story Mapping , Impact Mapping Techniques

Conflict Management:
Give some time for people can calm down. Diffuse it.
Have 1:1 with individuals if needed
Next step is to talk to the Team and facilitate.

It may give a false sense.. and blow out at the end..

Best Engineering Practices: Automation/Pair,Mob Programming, TDD, 

Facilitator: Steer in the right direction

If DoD is met, only then it is done, otherwise, it carry fwds. no Story points is counted.

Velocity can also be used by PO to do release planning/forecast. Velocity acts as a business metrics.

"SM: Help the Team see value in xxxxx" (Coaching)

20% productivity loss -- on context switching

Ralph Stacey ------------ Complex System Theory

Scrum works in Complex domain. Servant Leadership works. Self-Manage within the set Boundaries.

Business Agility: You (Org) can call themselves agile if: 
You respond to changing market conditions quickly?
We are increasing our ROI
We reduce our Risk of Investment (build product in small iterations)

** Cross Team not equals to full stack developer (they cant do all tasks)

Acceptance Criteria is not just PO responsibility.

Sprint Goal: Will give u focus, flexibility and purpose

Team Formation:
--------------------------
Set the Boundaries: n teams, mix of jr and senior, mix of skills (ui/dba/java)
Do this in a time box- say 2 hrs

Triz Technique - Liberation Structure
You are a Spy. How will u spoil a SM.

Empathy Map: (Have it in your Tool Kit)
--------------------------------

Metrics:
Quality | Value | Flow | Responsiveness | Improvement

Focus more on Business Metrics and less on Operational Metrics
