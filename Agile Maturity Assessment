By continuing to assess agility at regular intervals using Survey/Assessment, the team can track their progress.

What to do with the results is up to the team. Presumably, they would choose a single aspect/dimension of the assessment to improve upon, then continue to measure at regular intervals to see the results.

Levels of Maturity
Each assessment question is evaluated to one of six different levels of maturity as described below.

Level 0 – No Capability

Level 1 – Beginning
The team has some passing knowledge from reading books & articles. They are not yet applying the knowledge or are applying it on an ad hoc basis.

Level 2: Learning
The team actively tries to apply knowledge from training, books, and coaching.

Level 3: Practicing
The team understands the practice and uses it regularly.

Level 4: Measuring
The team applies advanced concepts and/or is using metrics to measure their abilities and effectiveness.

Level 5: Innovating
The team actively experiments with new methodologies and practices and is using metrics to measure the effects.
