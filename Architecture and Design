We used to develop software in a relatively predictable way, 
seeing the process as a project with a fairly fixed set of requirements and a period during which the software was developed and delivered.
In this era, we saw a lot of the key design decisions being made at the beginning of the process, and we didnâ€™t expect a lot to change during development.
